# Defend Base

**Defend Base** is a game. This is simple 2d (image spike oriented) game based on Java programming language. This is my fun project in exploring Java and my skill in programming. It is completely developed by me in the span of 1-2 months, only in the nights(after 12 AM, because I had access to shared computer). I am very much proud of this game because this is my first big project / game while I was learnig Java and working on this gave me such a r&d, problem solving skills.

I request you to play this game for once. I bet this wouldn't be a boring game you ever played ;)

If you want to play this game extract **Defend Base.rar** and open **DefendBase.jar**.

Thank you for stoping by :)
